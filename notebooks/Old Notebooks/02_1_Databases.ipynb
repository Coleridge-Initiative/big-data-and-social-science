This Python package implements the standard DBAPI Python interface for interacting with a relational database.  This is the closest you can get to connecting directly to the database in Python - there aren't any objects creating in-memory tables or layers of abstraction between you and the data.  Your Python sends SQL directly to the database and then deals row-by-row with the results.\n",

In practice, DBAPI drivers are about 95% compatible between databases and SQL for some tasks can be different from database to database, so you end up with code that can be ported between databases with a few tweaks and modifications, and then needing to test it all to make sure your SQL works."

    "`SQLAlchemy` is a higher-level Python database library that, among many other things, contains a wrapper around DBAPI that makes a subset of the DBAPI API work the same for any database `SQLAlchemy` supports (though it doesn't work exactly like DBAPI... nothing's perfect).  You can use this wrapper to write Python code that can be re-used with different databases (though  you'll have to make sure the SQL also is portable).  `SQLAlchemy` also includes advanced features like connection pooling in its implementation of DBAPI that help to make it perform better than a direct database connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just be aware that the farther you move from a direct connection, the more potential there is for things to go wrong.  Under the hood, `SQLAlchemy` is using `psycopg2` for its PostgreSQL database access, so now you have two relatively complex packages working in tandem.  If you get a particularly vexing bug running SQL with `SQLAlchemy`, in particular complex SQL or statements that update or alter the database, make sure to try that SQL with a pure DBAPI client or in the command line client to see if it is a problem with `SQLAlchemy`, not with your SQL or database.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SQLAlchemy`'s database connection is called an engine.  To connect a `SQLAlchemy` engine to a database, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a `SQLAlchemy` connection string for your database.\n",
    "- use that string to initialize an engine and connect it to your database.\n",
