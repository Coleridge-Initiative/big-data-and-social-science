    "- `numpy` is short for \"numerical Python\". `numpy` is a lynchpin in Python's scientific computing stack. Its strengths include a powerful *N*-dimensional array object, and a large suite of functions for doing numerical computing. \n",
    "- `pandas` is a library in Python for data analysis that uses the DataFrame object (modeled after R DataFrames, for those familiar with that language) which is similiar to a spreedsheet but allows you to do your analysis programaticaly rather than the point-and-click of Excel. It is a lynchpin of the PyData stack and is built on top of `numpy`.  \n",
